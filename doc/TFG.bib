@article{Portaluppi2018,
abstract = {We present the design and simulations of a single-photon sensitive imager based on single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) with an innovative pixel architecture that includes four separate SPADs with independent active time-gating and quenching circuit, a shared time-to-digital converter (TDC) with 50-ps resolution, four independent photon counters, and multiple operation modes. The TDC is driven by smart arbitration logic, which preserves spatial information among the four detectors; furthermore, an alternative operation mode exploits photon-coincidence on multiple detectors to reduce the effect of high background levels, e.g., in light detection and ranging applications with strong ambient light. Key features are the ability to operate in simultaneous photon counting and timing modes for capturing 2-D and 3-D images of the scene in a single shot (frame), the option of a counting-only mode, reducing power consumption, and increasing achievable frame-rate when timing information is not needed, and the ability to individually shut down noisy detectors or to enable just some regions of interests.},

@article{Sordo-Ibanez2013,
abstract = {Many image sensors employ column-parallel ADCs in their readout structures. Single-slope ADCs are ideally suited for these multi-channel applications due to their simplicity, low power and small overall area. The ramp generator, shared by all the converters in the readout architecture, is a key element that has a direct effect in the transfer characteristic of single-slope ADCs. Because a digital counter is inherently present in this conversion scheme, one common practice is to use a digital-to-analog converter driven by the counter to generate the ramp. Given the direct relationship between the DAC and the ADC transfer characteristics, one of the main issues is to ensure a sufficient linearity of the DAC, with special emphasis on its monotonicity. Very often, in particular when medium to high resolutions are aimed, this requires calibration of the DAC, which must be repeated every once in a while to account for temperature, process, power supply, and aging variations. This paper presents an inherently monotonic ramp generator with high levels of linearity and stability against any expected source of variations, combined with a very efficient realization and an inherent automatic adaptability to different resolutions. The ramp generator has been designed using radiation hardening by design (RHBD) techniques, allowing its use in space applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 TU Dresden.},

This paper presents the pixel and 2GS/s signal paths in a state-of-the-art Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor suitable for use in the latest Kinect sensor for Xbox One. ToF cameras determine the distance to objects by measuring the round trip travel time of an amplitude-modulated light from the source to the target and back to the camera at each pixel. ToF technology provides an accurate high pixel resolution, low motion blur, wide field of view (FoV), high dynamic range depth image as well as an ambient light invariant brightness image (active IR) that meets the highest quality requirements for 3D motion detection.},

abstract = {This brief provides a detailed analysis of active pixel sensor, pixel and column circuit. Surprisingly, we find that shorter readout times can be achieved by reducing the bias current and hence reducing energy consumption. We investigate the effect of nonidealities on the readout op- eration. We find that when the follower transistor channel-length modula- tion is taken into consideration, delay is reduced, which implies that shorter length transistors can be used in the pixel. We show that readout time de- creases linearly with technology scaling.},

The advantages of easy formability and low resistivity for both CoSi2 and TiSi2 have led to an intensive use of these silicides in self-aligned processes for simultaneous silicidation of source, drain and gate. The fundamental investigations of these silicides include thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of phase formation, interactions with doped Si and related defect generation, and the interaction with oxide and metals. Specific issues related to the technological implementation of silicides in a full process will be discussed in view of the trend to scale the silicided area both in the vertical and in the lateral dimensions.},
