abstract = {Includes index. "Written for layout designers, the mathematics is kept to a minimum, requiring only a familiarity with basic algebra and elementary electronics. Provides a carrier-based model for understanding device operation. Focuses on three processes: standard bipolar, polysilicon-gate CMOS, and analog BICMOS, enabling the reader to comprehend most new processes. Discusses the ways in which variations in layout geometries affect the performance of devices fabricated in silicon. Many exercises can be completed using pencil and paper for those who do not have access to layout editing software."--Jacket. 1. Device Physics -- 2. Semiconductor Fabrication -- 3.

@article{Salama2003,
abstract = {This brief provides a detailed analysis of active pixel sensor, pixel and column circuit. Surprisingly, we find that shorter readout times can be achieved by reducing the bias current and hence reducing energy consumption. We investigate the effect of nonidealities on the readout op- eration. We find that when the follower transistor channel-length modula- tion is taken into consideration, delay is reduced, which implies that shorter length transistors can be used in the pixel. We show that readout time de- creases linearly with technology scaling.},

@book{Baker2010,
abstract = {The Third Edition of CMOS Circuit Design, Layout, and Simulation continues to cover the practical design of both analog and digital integrated circuits, offering a vital, contemporary view of a wide range of analog/digital circuit blocks including: phase-locked-loops, delta-sigma sensing circuits, voltage/current references, op-amps, the design of data converters, and much more. Regardless of one's integrated circuit (IC) design skill level, this book allows readers to experience both the theory behind, and the hands-on implementation of, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) IC design via detailed derivations, discussions, and hundreds of design, layout, and simulation examples.},
