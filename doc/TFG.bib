Provides a carrier-based model for understanding device operation. Focuses on three processes: standard bipolar, polysilicon-gate CMOS, and analog BICMOS, enabling the reader to comprehend most new processes. Discusses the ways in which variations in layout geometries affect the performance of devices fabricated in silicon. Many exercises can be completed using pencil and paper for those who do not have access to layout editing software."--Jacket. 1. Device Physics -- 2. Semiconductor Fabrication -- 3.

@article{Maex:silicides,
abstract = {Silicides have been a topic of intensive research for more than a decade.The driving force for these investigations has certainly been the interesting materials aspects of the silicides and their applications in integrated circuits. The advantages of easy formability and low resistivity for both CoSi2 and TiSi2 have led to an intensive use of these silicides in self-aligned processes for simultaneous silicidation of source, drain and gate. The fundamental investigations of these silicides include thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of phase formation, interactions with doped Si and related defect generation, and the interaction with oxide and metals. Specific issues related to the technological implementation of silicides in a full process will be discussed in view of the trend to scale the silicided area both in the vertical and in the lateral dimensions.},

@article{Salama2003:active_pixel_sensor_ro,
abstract = {This brief provides a detailed analysis of active pixel sensor, pixel and column circuit. Surprisingly, we find that shorter readout times can be achieved by reducing the bias current and hence reducing energy consumption. We investigate the effect of nonidealities on the readout op- eration. We find that when the follower transistor channel-length modula- tion is taken into consideration, delay is reduced, which implies that shorter length transistors can be used in the pixel. We show that readout time de- creases linearly with technology scaling.},
