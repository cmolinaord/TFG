@book{Nakamura2005a,
abstract = {Shrinking pixel sizes along with improvements in image sensors, optics, and electronics have elevated DSCs to levels of performance that match, and have the potential to surpass, that of silver-halide film cameras. Image Sensors and Signal Processing for Digital Still Cameras captures the current state of DSC image acquisition and signal processing technology and takes an all-inclusive look at the field, from the history of DSCs to future possibilities. The first chapter outlines the evolution of DSCs, their basic structure, and their major application classes. The next few chapters discuss high-quality optics that meet the requirements of better image sensors, the basic functions and performance parameters of image sensors, and detailed discussions of both CCD and CMOS image sensors. The book then discusses how color theory affects the uses of DSCs, presents basic image processing and camera control algorithms and examples of advanced image processing algorithms, explores the architecture and required performance of signal processing engines, and explains how to evaluate image quality for each component described. The book closes with a look at future technologies and the challenges that must be overcome to realize them. With contributions from many active DSC experts, Image Sensors and Image Processing for Digital Still Cameras offers unparalleled real-world coverage and opens wide the door for future innovation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a CMOS imager with a column-parallel ADC architecture based on a multiple-ramp single-slope (MRSS) ADC. Like the well-known column-level single-slope ADC, an MRSS ADC uses a very simple analog column circuit, which mainly consists of an analog comparator and some switches. A prototype imager using the MRSS ADC architecture was realized in a 0.25 CMOS process. Measurements demonstrate that the conversion speed of an MRSS ADC is 3.3 higher than a single-slope ADC while dissipating only 16{\%} more power. Furthermore, the MRSS ADC can be easily adapted to exhibit a companding characteristic, which exploits the amplitude-dependent nature of the photon shot noise present in imager signals. Measurements show that the resulting multiple-ramp multiple-slope ADC is 25{\%} faster than an MRSS ADC while dissipating the same amount of power.},

abstract = {This brief provides a detailed analysis of active pixel sensor, pixel and column circuit. Surprisingly, we find that shorter readout times can be achieved by reducing the bias current and hence reducing energy consumption. We investigate the effect of nonidealities on the readout op- eration. We find that when the follower transistor channel-length modula- tion is taken into consideration, delay is reduced, which implies that shorter length transistors can be used in the pixel. We show that readout time de- creases linearly with technology scaling.},

@article{Fowler1998,
abstract = {Two techniques for performing pixel level analog to digital conversion (ADC) are reviewed. The first is an over-sampling technique which uses a one bit first order Ez modulator for each 2 x 2 block of pixels to directly convert photocharge to bits. Each modulator is implemented using 17 transistors. The second technique is a Nyquist rate multi—channel--bit—serial (MCBS) ADC. The technique uses successive comparisons to convert the pixel voltage to bits. Results obtained from implementations of these ADC techniques are presented. The techniques are compared based on size, charge handling capacity, FPN, noise sensitivity, data throughput, quantization, memory/processing, and power dissipation requirements for both visible and JR imagers. From the comparison it appears that the L$\backslash$ ADC is better suited to JR imagers, while the MCBS ADC is better suited to imagers in the visible range.},

@article{Portaluppi2018,
abstract = {We present the design and simulations of a single-photon sensitive imager based on single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) with an innovative pixel architecture that includes four separate SPADs with independent active time-gating and quenching circuit, a shared time-to-digital converter (TDC) with 50-ps resolution, four independent photon counters, and multiple operation modes. The TDC is driven by smart arbitration logic, which preserves spatial information among the four detectors; furthermore, an alternative operation mode exploits photon-coincidence on multiple detectors to reduce the effect of high background levels, e.g., in light detection and ranging applications with strong ambient light. Key features are the ability to operate in simultaneous photon counting and timing modes for capturing 2-D and 3-D images of the scene in a single shot (frame), the option of a counting-only mode, reducing power consumption, and increasing achievable frame-rate when timing information is not needed, and the ability to individually shut down noisy detectors or to enable just some regions of interests.},

@article{Sordo-Ibanez2013,
abstract = {Many image sensors employ column-parallel ADCs in their readout structures. Single-slope ADCs are ideally suited for these multi-channel applications due to their simplicity, low power and small overall area. The ramp generator, shared by all the converters in the readout architecture, is a key element that has a direct effect in the transfer characteristic of single-slope ADCs. Because a digital counter is inherently present in this conversion scheme, one common practice is to use a digital-to-analog converter driven by the counter to generate the ramp. Given the direct relationship between the DAC and the ADC transfer characteristics, one of the main issues is to ensure a sufficient linearity of the DAC, with special emphasis on its monotonicity. Very often, in particular when medium to high resolutions are aimed, this requires calibration of the DAC, which must be repeated every once in a while to account for temperature, process, power supply, and aging variations. This paper presents an inherently monotonic ramp generator with high levels of linearity and stability against any expected source of variations, combined with a very efficient realization and an inherent automatic adaptability to different resolutions. The ramp generator has been designed using radiation hardening by design (RHBD) techniques, allowing its use in space applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 TU Dresden.},

abstract = {Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are presently the technology of choice for most imaging applications. In the 23 years since their invention in 1970, they have evolved to a sophisticated level of performance. However, as with all technologies, we can be certain that they will be supplanted someday. In this paper, the Active Pixel Sensor (APS) technology is explored as a possible successor to the CCD. An active pixel is defined as a detector array technology that has at least one active transistor within the pixel unit cell. The APS eliminates the need for nearly perfect charge transfer--the Achilles' heel of CCDs. This perfect charge transfer makes CCD's radiation 'soft,' difficult to use under low light conditions, difficult to manufacture in large array sizes, difficult to integrate with on-chip electronics, difficult to use at low temperatures, difficult to use at high frame rates, and difficult to manufacture in non-silicon materials that extend wavelength response. With the active pixel, the signal is driven from the pixel over metallic wires rather than being physically transported in the semiconductor. This paper makes a case for the development of APS technology. The state of the art is reviewed and the application of APS technology to future space-based scientific sensor systems is addressed.},

Working from the forefront of CMOS technology, Phil and Doug have combined their expertise as engineers and academics to present a cutting-edge and effective overview of the principles and techniques for designing circuits. Their two main goals are: * to mix the academic and practical viewpoints in a treatment that is neither superficial nor overly detailed * to teach analog integrated circuit design with a hierarchically organized approach Most of the circuits, techniques, and principles presented in CMOS Analog Circuit Design come directly from the authors' industrial experience, making the book a valuable resource for both practicing engineers and students taking courses in analog electronics or CMOS analog design. The trademark approach of Phil and Doug's textbook is its design recipes, which take readers step-by-step through the creation of real circuits, explaining and demystifying complex design problems. The book provides detailed coverage of often-neglected areas and deliberately leaves out bipolar analog circuits, since CMOS is the dominant technology for analog integrated circuit design. Appropriate for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with background knowledge in basic electronics--including biasing, modeling, circuit, analysis, and frequency response--CMOS Analog Circuit Design, Third Edition, presents a complete picture of design (including modeling, simulation, and testing) and enables readers to undertake the design of an analog circuit that can be implemented by CMOS technology.
